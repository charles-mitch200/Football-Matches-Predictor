# Football Matches Predictor
## Overview
Welcome to the Football Matches Predictor project! This repository contains a machine learning solution for predicting outcomes of football matches. The project leverages various models, including a baseline model, logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier, to analyze historical match data and make predictions for future matches.

## Features
The project includes the following key features:
**Baseline Model: A simple baseline model to establish a reference for performance comparison.**

**Logistic Regression: A logistic regression model for binary classification of match outcomes.**

**Decision Tree Classifier: A decision tree-based model to capture complex relationships within the data.**

**Random Forest Classifier: A powerful ensemble model for improved predictive accuracy and robustness.**

## Dataset
The models are trained and evaluated using a dataset containing information about football matches, including team rankings, halftime scores, and betting odds. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and create meaningful features for model training.

## Models Evaluation
Performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are provided for each model to assess their effectiveness in predicting football match outcomes.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to enhance existing models, add new features, or optimize code, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request to contribute to the development of a more accurate football match predictor.
